# Individual Project - Generative Scene Generation

## Overview

This project, **Generative Scene Generation**, explores how **AI-generated visual content** (images and videos) can be used to construct **3D scenes** through the process of **3D Gaussian Splatting**. The work combines insights from computer vision, deep learning, and 3D reconstruction to evaluate the potential of generative models for creating realistic 3D environments from synthetic data.

## Project Goals

- Study the **3D Gaussian Splatting** paper and related research to understand the theoretical framework behind the technique.
- Investigate how **3D Gaussians** can represent 3D space derived from **AI-generated imagery**.
- Develop a **practical implementation** that uses open-source **AI image** and **video generation** tools to create visual data, which will then be processed with **COLMAP** (or other software) and **3D Gaussian Splatting** to form a 3D scene.
- Compare the AI-generated 3D reconstruction with a **real-world 3D scan**, identify the limitations, and propose potential improvements or solutions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Generation:** Use open-source AI models to produce images and videos as input.
2. **3D Reconstruction:** Employ **COLMAP** for structure-from-motion (SfM) processing and **3D Gaussian Splatting** for scene representation.
3. **Comparison and Analysis:** Evaluate how the AI-generated reconstruction differs from real-world 3D data and discuss corrective techniques.
